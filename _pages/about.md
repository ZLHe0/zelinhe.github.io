I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Statistics at Penn State. This summer, I will be joining [Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/career-programs/student-programs) as a research scientist intern. I am advised by Dr. [Runze Li](https://runzelipsu.github.io/) and in collaboration with Dr. [Ying Sun](https://ysunac.github.io/) from the EECS department. My current research focuses on designing transfer learning methods for high-dimensional dataset modeling under crowd-sourcing settings.
